  "architectural_notes": [
    "Include explicit disclaimers to avoid implying official Tesla affiliation/endorsement.",
    "Avoid trademark infringement: do not use a Tesla-similar logo or Tesla-owned brand assets; create an original brand identity.",
    "After plan selection, route users through signup -> success -> final Telegram CTA linking to https://t.me/Portal_fx_sign (Telegram step is the final page).",
    "CEO/partner section must not include real employee photos/names; Elon Musk can be listed by name/title only with clear non-endorsement wording and no photo.",
    "User requested removing all disclaimers/non-affiliation/non-endorsement text site-wide (high legal/trademark/endorsement risk).",
    "Post-signup (Create Account) must redirect to a standalone Telegram CTA page that contains a short professional write-up and a clickable link/button to https://t.me/Portal_fx_sign.",
    "Rebrand: replace all “Portalfxsign” branding with “TelsFX” site-wide; keep the rest of the UI/design unchanged.",
    "Logo direction updated: create a classic, Tesla-inspired logo style but ensure it is clearly original and non-infringing (do not replicate Tesla’s T or trade dress).",
    "Update global route-transition UX to show loading spinner for ~0.1 seconds (near-instant) before navigation, while keeping the fade-in on destination page entry.",

  "known_issues": [
    "Requested logo “similar to Tesla” may create trademark/trade dress risk; needs redesign to be clearly original.",
    "Existing generated portrait image requirements (e.g., 'Lomos' and partner portraits) may conflict with updated requirement to avoid fictional/placeholder executive profiles; clarify whether portraits should be removed or repurposed as non-personal UI imagery.",
    "Using Elon Musk’s name/title requires careful disclaimering to avoid implying endorsement or affiliation; do not use his photo.",
    "Removing all non-affiliation/non-endorsement disclaimers substantially increases risk of implying Tesla/Elon Musk/company endorsement or affiliation; potential legal/trademark/false endorsement exposure.",
    "Standalone Telegram page and/or post-signup redirect may be missing or not wired correctly (user reports Create Account does not lead to the standalone Telegram link page).",
    "Rebranding to “TelsFX” plus a Tesla-resembling logo increases trademark/trade dress risk; ensure logo remains clearly original and does not copy Tesla’s mark.",
    "Mobile issue: after clicking any clickable button (Create Account, Access Plans, plan cards, Products), spinner shows but navigation does not occur; user remains on Home page with no URL/fade change.",
    "Owner cannot access /users admin page (Access Denied) and does not know their Internet Identity/admin Principal; project lacks a clear way to view/reset/configure admin principal, causing admin lockout.",
    "User requested collection/forwarding of SSN and passwords; high security/privacy risk and likely non-compliant—must be rejected or redesigned (do not store/forward passwords; avoid SSN collection).",
    "Replacing Internet Identity with email+password admin auth introduces additional security risk (credential storage, brute-force protection, session handling) and must be implemented carefully."

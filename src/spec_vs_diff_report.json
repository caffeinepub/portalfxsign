  "summary": "The diff adds a new Privacy Policy page and registers a /privacy route, and wires the footer Privacy Policy button to navigate via the existing route-transition hook. However, the diff summary also indicates multiple unrelated site changes (landing/plans/products pages, route-transition hook behavior, branding/title updates, admin features), which conflicts with the request to keep the rest of the site intact and to not change global route-transition behavior beyond reusing it.",

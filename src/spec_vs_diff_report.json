  "summary": "Implemented a new /admin-help route and added admin-principal configuration guidance, plus updates toward showing principal info in the admin access gate. Admin /users route remains gated and backend admin-only listing is enforced. However, due to truncation, some REQ-47 acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. Several unrelated UI/branding/content changes appear to have been made that are outside the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "AdminAccessGate.tsx is truncated before the Access Denied Card content. While the code computes `currentPrincipal` and includes copy/help handlers, the diff excerpt does not show the principal being rendered as text nor the required configuration instructions being displayed.",

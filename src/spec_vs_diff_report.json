  "summary": "The diff applies a new global background wrapper class (`app-vector-bg`) in the root layout and defines a fixed SVG background layer in global CSS, but it does not add the required SVG asset and does not show removal of the existing `gradient-bg-right` dual-gradient (::before/::after) implementation.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-93",
      "requirement": "Generate a new vector-based abstract background design that transitions from green to teal and is visually pronounced.",
      "reason": "No new SVG asset was added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` in the diff (Added: 0). CSS references the expected SVG path, but the asset itself is not present in the provided changes.",

      "requirement": "Replace the existing global dual-layer green gradient background (via `gradient-bg-right` and its `::before/::after`) with the new vector background and apply it globally from a single global place.",
      "reason": "Global application from a single place appears implemented via `app-vector-bg` in `RootLayout` and global CSS, but the diff does not show removal of the prior `gradient-bg-right` class or its `::before/::after` radial gradient layers, so replacement (and elimination of the old effect) is not evidenced.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (adds `app-vector-bg` wrapper in RootLayout)",
        "frontend/src/index.css (adds `.app-vector-bg::before` background layer)"

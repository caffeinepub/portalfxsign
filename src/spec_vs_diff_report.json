  "summary": "REQ-45 appears implemented: the footer “Contact Us” now calls useRouteTransition().startTransition('/telegram'). However, the diff also makes substantial unrequested changes to the footer’s content/layout and modifies Terms/Privacy behavior, which violates the request’s constraint to only rewire the existing “Contact Us” click action.",
